          <p>
            If the above command does not work, try executing /opt/lampp/xampp

            interchanged.

      <div>
        <h1>Instructions:</h1>
        <div class="Instructions">
          In this lab, you are asked to complete the following tasks:<br /><br />
          <ol>
            <li>
              Write a README file for the website you are going to create in this
              semester. The README file should include a clear description of the
              services you are going to provide, the target audience, and the
              goals of the website.
            </li>
            <li>
              Your teacher will validate the README file or ask you to make some
              changes.
            </li>
            <li>
              Draw a site map for the website you are going to create in this
              semester. The site map should include all the pages you are going to
              create.
            </li>
            <li>
              Divide the workload among your team members. Each team member
              should be responsible for a specific part of the website. The
              division of work should be included in the README file. This will
              help you to avoid conflicts and misunderstandings among team
              members. It will also help you to complete the project on time.
              Your teacher will validate the division of work or ask you to make
              some changes.
            </li>
            <li>
              The course teacher will create a GitHub repository for your team.
              You will need to upload the README file and the site map to the
              GitHub repository. The repository should be shared with your teacher
              and your team members.
            </li>
          </ol>
          You can find bellow some questions that will help you to write the
          README file. You can also find an example of a site map.
