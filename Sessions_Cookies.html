        <li>HTTP is a stateless protocol, which means that each request is independent of the others. This is
          fine for most web pages, but it can be a problem if you want to keep track of users as they move
          around your site. For example, you might want to keep track of users so that you can:
          <ol>
            <li>Personalize the content of your site for them</li>
            <li>Keep track of their shopping carts</li>
            <li>Keep track of their progress through a multi-page form</li>
            <li>Keep track of their login status</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>PHP provides three ways to keep track of users:
          <ol>
            <li>Using cookies</li>
            <li>Using sessions</li>
            <li>Using HTTP authentication</li>
          </ol>
        </li>

    <h1 class="Title">Cookies</h1>
    <section>
      <div class="Definitions">
        <ul>
          <li>A cookie is an item of data that a web server saves to your computer's hard disk via a
            web browser.</li>
          <li>It can contain almost any alphanumeric information (as long as it's
            under 4 KB) and can be retrieved from your computer and returned to the server</li>
          <li>Because of their privacy implications, cookies can be read only from the issuing
            domain.</li>
          <li>
            Third-party cookies are cookies that are set by a domain other than the one you are currently
            visiting. For example, if you visit a site that has a Facebook Like button, Facebook will set a
            cookie on your computer. This cookie will be sent to Facebook when you visit other sites that
            have Facebook Like buttons. This allows Facebook to track your browsing habits across the
            web.
          </li>
          <li>Cookies are exchanged during the transfer of headers, before the actual HTML of a
            web page is sent, and it is impossible to send a cookie once any HTML has been
            transferred.</li>

      <div class="Definitions">
        This exchange shows a browser receiving two pages:
        <ol>
          <li>The browser issues a request to retrieve the main page, index.html, at the website
            http://www.webserver.com. The first header specifies the file, and the second
            header specifies the server.</li>
          <li>When the web server at webserver.com receives this pair of headers, it returns
            some of its own. The second header defines the type of content to be sent (text/
            html), and the third one sends a cookie of the name name and with the value
            value. Only then are the contents of the web page transferred.</li>
          <li>Once the browser has received the cookie, it will then return it with every future
            request made to the issuing server until the cookie expires or is deleted. So, when
            the browser requests the new page /news.html, it also returns the cookie name
            with the value value.</li>
          <li>Because the cookie has already been set, when the server receives the request to
            send /news.html, it does not have to resend the cookie but just returns the requested
            page.</li>

    <h1 class="Section_Title">Implementing Simple Sessions</h1>
    <section>
      <div class="Definitions">
        The basic steps of using sessions in PHP are:
        <ol>
          <li>Starting a session</li>
          <li>Registering session variables</li>
          <li>Using session variables</li>
          <li>Deregistering variables and destroying the session</li>
        </ol>
      </div>
    </section>
    <h1 class="Section_Title">Starting a session</h1>
    <section>
      <div class="Definitions">
        There are two ways you can do this:
        <ol>
          <li>The first, and simplest, is to begin a script with a call to the session_start() function. <br>
            This function checks to see whether there is already a current session. If not, it will create
            one, providing access to the superglobal $_SESSION array. If a session already exists,
            session_start() loads the registered session variables so that you can use them.
          </li>
          <li>
            The second way you can begin a session is to set PHP to start one automatically when someone
            comes to your site. You can do this by using the session.auto_start option in your php.ini
            file. <br>
            This option is set to 0 by default, which means that sessions are not started automatically.
            If you set it to 1, sessions will be started automatically (<a href="https://php.net/session.auto-start">See
              doc</a>). <br>
            This is not recommended, however, because it can cause problems if you have a lot of traffic on your site.
            It is better to start sessions only when you need them. <br>
            Note: If you are using a hosting service, you may not have access to the php.ini file. In that
            case, you will have to use the first method.

          <li>The session variable you have just created will be tracked until the session ends or until you
            manually unset it. The session may also naturally expire based on the session.gc_maxlifetime
            setting in the php.ini file. This setting determines the amount of time (in seconds) that a session
            will last before it is ended by the garbage collector. By default, this is set to 1440 seconds (24

        <ul>
          <li>When you are finished with a session variable, you can unset it. You can do this directly by
            unsetting the appropriate element of the $_SESSION array.</li>

        <h3>Setting a Timeout</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            There are other times when you might wish to close a user's session yourself, such as
            when the user has forgotten or neglected to log out, and you want the program to do
            so for them for their own security. You do this by setting the timeout after which a
            logout will automatically occur if there has been no activity.</li>
          <li>
            To do this, use the ini_set function as follows. This example sets the timeout to
            exactly one day (the letters gc standing for garbage collection): <br>
            <font color="green">ini_set('session.gc_maxlifetime', 60 * 60 * 24);</font>
          </li>
          <li>
            If you wish to know what the current timeout period is, you can display it using the following: <br>
            <font color="green">echo ini_get('session.gc_maxlifetime');</font>

          <li>Once a user has been authenticated, you will not be able to get the
            authentication dialog to pop up again unless the user closes and
            reopens all browser windows, because the web browser will keep
            returning the same username and password to PHP.</li>
          <li>HTTP authentication is not secure. The username and password are sent in plain text, so
            anyone who can intercept the request can read them. You should use HTTP authentication
            only over a secure connection (https://).</li>
