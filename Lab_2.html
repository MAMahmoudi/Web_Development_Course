          In this lab, you will learn how to pull your project from the repository to your local machine. <br>
          You will also learn how to set up the project structure and start working on your project. <br>
          Follow the instructions below to complete the lab. <br>

      <h2 class="Section_Title">Pulling your project</h2>
      <div class="Definitions">
        <p>
          At this point you should have a team already created and a project assigned to you. If you do not have a
          project assigned to you, please contact your instructor. <br>
          To start working on your project, you will need to pull the project from the repository to your local machine.
          Since we are using XAMPP, you will need to pull the project to the htdocs folder. <br>
          To pull the project, you will need to use the command line. Open the command line and navigate to the htdocs
          folder. <br>
          Once you are in the htdocs folder, you will need to use the git clone command to pull the project. <br>
          The git clone command is used to create a copy of the repository on your local machine. <br>
          The syntax for the git clone command is as follows:
        </p>
      </div>
      <pre class="prettyprint">
        $ cd C:/xampp/htdocs
        $ git clone https://github.com/the-repository-url
    </pre>
      <div class="Definitions">
        <p>
          where the-repository-url is the URL of the repository you want to clone. <br>
        </p>
      </div>
      <h2 class="Sub_Section_Title">Windows</h2>
      <div class="Definitions">
        <p>
          If you are using Windows, you can use GitHub Desktop to clone the repository. <br>
          GitHub Desktop is a graphical user interface for Git that makes it easier to work with repositories. <br>
          To download GitHub Desktop, go to the following website: <br>
          <a href="https://desktop.github.com/">https://desktop.github.com/</a> <br>
          To clone the repository using GitHub Desktop, follow these steps: <br>
        <ol>
          <li>Open GitHub Desktop.</li>
          <li>Click on the "File" menu and select "Clone repository".</li>
          <li>In the "Clone a repository" window, enter the URL of the repository you want to clone.</li>
          <li>Click on the "Clone" button.</li>
          <li>Choose the location where you want to clone the repository.</li>
          <li>Click on the "Clone" button.</li>
          <li>Wait for the repository to be cloned.</li>
          <li>Once the repository is cloned, you can start working on your project.</li>
        </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
          At this point, you should have the project cloned to your local machine. You can now start working on your
          project. <br>

      <h2 class="Section_Title">The structure of a project</h2>
      <div class="Definitions">
        <p>
          When you start working on a project, it is important to have a clear structure for your project. <br>
          A good project structure will help you organize your files and folders in a way that makes it easy to find
          what you need. <br>
          In this section, we will discuss the structure of a typical web project. <br>
        </p>
        <p>
          Unless you are working with a specific framework or tool that has its own structure, you are free to organize
          your project in any way you like. <br>
          A typical web project will have the following structure: <br>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>index.php</strong> - The main PHP file for the project. This file is usually the entry point
            for the project and contains the content that will be displayed to the user.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>assets</strong> - A folder that contains all the assets used in the project, such as images,
            fonts, and JavaScript files.
            <ol type="a">
              <li>
                <strong>CSS</strong> - A folder that contains the CSS files for the project. CSS files are used to style
                the HTML content.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>JS</strong> - A folder that contains the JavaScript files for the project. JavaScript files are
                used to add interactivity to the project.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Images</strong> - A folder that contains the images used in the project.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Fonts</strong> - A folder that contains the fonts used in the project.
              </li>
            </ol>
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Components</strong> - Depending on the way you divide the worklload among your team members, you may
            assign each member a specific component to work on. For example, if you are working on a website that has a
            header, footer, and main content area, you may assign one team member to work on the header, another team
            member
            to work on the footer, and another team member to work on the main content area. Each team member will be
            responsible for creating the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files for their component. <br>
            The PHP files for the components can be stored in a folder called components. <br>
          </li>
        </ol>
        </p>
