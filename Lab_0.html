                    In this lab, you will learn how to create a GitHub account, join a team, and clone a repository. You
                    will also learn how to install Git and configure it for the first time. Finally, you will learn the
                    basics of Git and how to use it to track changes in your project.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The first step is to choose a team and a project. You can choose your team members and your project
                    based on your interests and skills. Each team will have a project to work on during the semester.
                    The project will be divided into tasks that will be assigned to each team member. <br>
                    Teams must have at least 3 members and at most 4 members.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The project is a website that you will develop using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP. The website
                    must
                    have
                    at least 5 web services. Web services are all the interactions between the front end and the back
                    end regarding a specific item.
                    These interactions can be grouped into four categories: Creation, Reading, Updating, and Deleting
                    (CRUD).
                    For example, in an E-commerce website, a service may concern product management. i.e. creating a new
                    product, reading a list of products and displaying it to the user, updating its attributes (name,
                    quantity, ...etc.), or deleting it from the database.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you have not chosen a team and a project yet, you can do so by going to the web development
                    classroom.
                    A form will be available for you to fill in your team members and your project. <br>
                    <strong>Only one team member has to fill out the form.</strong>

                    GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work
                    together on projects from anywhere. <br>
                    You must create an account using your university email address. This account will be used to access
                    the repositories created by your teacher and to submit your work. <br>
                    To create a GitHub account, you need to go to the official website: <a
                        href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> then click on the "Sign up" button and follow the
                    instructions. <br>
                    If you already have an account with your personal email address, you can add your university email
                    address to your account by going to your account settings then clicking on the "Emails" tab and
                    adding your university email address.

                    project and add you to the team. You will receive an invitation email to join the team and access
                    the
                    repository. <strong>Make sure to accept the invitation to be able to access the repository.</strong>

            <div class="Definitions">
                <p>Git is a distributed version control system that is used to track changes in source code during
                    software
                    development. It is designed to coordinate work among programmers, but it can be used to track
                    changes in
                    any set of files. Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear
                    workflows.

                    There are several ways to install Git on macOS. The easiest is probably to install the Xcode
                    Command Line Tools. On Mavericks (10.9) or above you can do this simply by trying to run git from
                    the Terminal the very first time.

                <p>
                    If you don't have it installed already, it will prompt you to install it. <br>
                    If you want a more up to date version, you can also install it via a binary installer. A macOS Git
                    installer is maintained and available for download at the Git website, at <a

                    If you want to install the basic Git tools on Linux via a binary installer, you can generally do so
                    through the package management tool that comes with your distribution. If you're on Fedora (or
                    any closely-related RPM-based distribution, such as RHEL or CentOS), you can use dnf:

                    After you install Git, you need to configure it only once on any computer. These configurations can
                    be changed later on if needed by runing the same commands.

                    The first thing you should do when you install Git
                    is to set your user name and email address. This is important because every Git commit uses this
                    information, and it's immutably baked into the commits you start creating:</p>

                    In our case, we will clone existing repositories from GitHub. Since the latters will be created by
                    your teacher, you will only need to clone them.

                            they can be unmodified, modified, or staged. In short, tracked files are files that Git
                            knows about.

                            Untracked files are everything else — any files in your working directory that were not in
                            your last snapshot and are not in your staging area. When you first clone a repository, all
                            of your
                            files will be tracked and unmodified because Git just checked them out and you haven't

                <p>
                    As you edit files, Git sees them as modified, because you've changed them since your last commit.
                    As you work, you selectively stage these modified files and then commit all those staged changes,
                    and the cycle repeats.
