            <div class="Definitions">
                <p>Git is a distributed version control system that is used to track changes in source code during
                    software
                    development. It is designed to coordinate work among programmers, but it can be used to track
                    changes in
                    any set of files. Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear
                    workflows.

                    There are several ways to install Git on macOS. The easiest is probably to install the Xcode
                    Command Line Tools. On Mavericks (10.9) or above you can do this simply by trying to run git from
                    the Terminal the very first time.

                <p>
                    If you don't have it installed already, it will prompt you to install it. <br>
                    If you want a more up to date version, you can also install it via a binary installer. A macOS Git
                    installer is maintained and available for download at the Git website, at <a

                    If you want to install the basic Git tools on Linux via a binary installer, you can generally do so
                    through the package management tool that comes with your distribution. If you're on Fedora (or
                    any closely-related RPM-based distribution, such as RHEL or CentOS), you can use dnf:

                    After you install Git, you need to configure it only once on any computer. These configurations can
                    be changed later on if needed by runing the same commands.

                    The first thing you should do when you install Git
                    is to set your user name and email address. This is important because every Git commit uses this
                    information, and it's immutably baked into the commits you start creating:</p>

                    If you want to change the default branch name from "master" to "main", you can run the following
                    command:

                    You can get a Git repository in two ways: by cloning an existing repository from elsewhere
                    or by creating a new repository from a local directory. <br>
                    In our case, we will clone existing repositories from GitHub. Since the latters will be created by
                    your teacher, you will only need to clone them.

                    To clone an existing repository, you need to go to the directory for your project in your local
                    machine then run the clone command followed by the repository URL
                    (i.e. git clone &lt;url>):

                    Each file in your working directory can be in one of two states: tracked or
                    untracked.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Tracked files: </strong>
                        <p>
                            These files are files that were in the last snapshot, as well as any newly staged files;
                            they can be unmodified, modified, or staged. In short, tracked files are files that Git
                            knows about.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Untracked files: </strong>
                        <p>
                            Untracked files are everything else â€” any files in your working directory that were not in
                            your last snapshot and are not in your staging area. When you first clone a repository, all
                            of your
                            files will be tracked and unmodified because Git just checked them out and you haven't
                            edited anything.
                        </p>

                </ul>
                <p>
                    As you edit files, Git sees them as modified, because you've changed them since your last commit.
                    As you work, you selectively stage these modified files and then commit all those staged changes,
                    and the cycle repeats.

                    In order to begin tracking a new file, you use the command git add. The git add command takes a path
                    name for either a file or a directory; if it's a directory, the command adds all the files in that
                    directory recursively. To add all files in the directory, you can use the dot (.) symbol.

                    run the git commit command followed by the -m flag and the commit message. Remember
                    that anything that is still unstaged â€” any files you have created or modified that you haven't run
                    git add on since you edited them â€” won't go into this commit. They will stay as modified files on
                    your disk.
