                <p>Git is a distributed version control system that is used to track changes in source code during
                    software
                    development. It is designed to coordinate work among programmers, but it can be used to track
                    changes in
                    any set of files. Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear
                    workflows.

                    There are several ways to install Git on macOS. The easiest is probably to install the Xcode
                    Command Line Tools. On Mavericks (10.9) or above you can do this simply by trying to run git from
                    the Terminal the very first time.

                <p>
                    If you don't have it installed already, it will prompt you to install it. <br>
                    If you want a more up to date version, you can also install it via a binary installer. A macOS Git
                    installer is maintained and available for download at the Git website, at <a

                    If you want to install the basic Git tools on Linux via a binary installer, you can generally do so
                    through the package management tool that comes with your distribution. If youâ€™re on Fedora (or
                    any closely-related RPM-based distribution, such as RHEL or CentOS), you can use dnf:
                </p>
            </div>
            <pre class="prettyprint">
                $ sudo dnf install git-all
            </pre>
            <div class="Definitions">
                <p>
                    If you're on a Debian-based distribution like Ubuntu, try apt:
                </p>
            </div>
            <pre class="prettyprint">
                $ sudo apt install git-all
            </pre>
