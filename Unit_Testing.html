      <div class="Definitions">
        <p>
          Composer is a tool for dependency management in PHP. It allows you to
          declare the libraries your project depends on and it will manage
          (install/update) them for you. <br>
          <br>
          Composer is not a package manager in the same sense as Yum or Apt are.
          Yes, it deals with "packages" or libraries, but it manages them on a
          per-project basis, installing them in a directory (e.g. vendor) inside
          your project. By default it will never install anything globally. <br>
          <br>
          Moreover, Composer supports autoloading of classes, which means that
          you can use classes without even including the files that define them.

      <h1 class="Sub_Section_Title">How to install Composer?</h1>
      <div class="Definitions">
        <p>
          Composer offers a convenient installer that you can execute directly
          from the command line. Feel free to download this file or review it on
          GitHub if you wish to know more about the inner workings of the
          installer. <br>
          <br>
          To install composer, run the following command in your terminal:
          <br>
          <br>
          <code>php -r "copy('https://getcomposer.org/installer', 'composer-setup.php');"</code>
          <br>
          <br>
          <code>php -r "if (hash_file('sha384', 'composer-setup.php') === 'e0012edf3e80b6978849f5eff0d4b4e4c79ff1609dd1e613307e16318854d24ae64f26d17af3ef0bf7cfb710ca74755a') { echo 'Installer verified'; } else { echo
            'Installer corrupt'; unlink('composer-setup.php'); } echo PHP_EOL;"</code>
          <br>
          <br>
          <code>php composer-setup.php</code>
          <br>
          <br>
          <code>php -r "unlink('composer-setup.php');"</code>
          <br>
          <br>
          This installer script will simply check some php.ini settings, warn you
          if they are set incorrectly, and then download the latest composer.phar
          in the current directory. The 4 lines above will, in order: <br>
          <br>
          1. Download the installer to the current directory <br>
          2. Verify the installer SHA-384 which you can also cross-check here <br>
          3. Run the installer <br>
          4. Remove the installer <br>
          <br>
          You can install Composer to a specific directory by using the --install-dir option and providing a target
          directory. <br>
          <br>
          <code>php composer-setup.php --install-dir=bin</code>
          <br>
          <br>
          Alternatively, you can install Composer globally. <br>
          <br>
          <code>php composer-setup.php --install-dir=bin --filename=composer</code>
          <br>
          <br>
          Note: If the above fails due to permissions, you may need to run it
          again with sudo. <br>
          <br>
          Note: Composer requires PHP 5.3.2+ to run. A few sensitive php settings
          and compile flags are also required, but when using the installer you
          will be warned about any incompatibilities. <br>
          <br>
          Note: If you are running OS X, you can also install Composer by
          following the instructions here. <br>
          <br>
          Note: If you are on Windows and have XAMPP installed, you may need to
          use the <code>php</code> command instead of <code>php</code> when following the
          command-line installation instructions above. <br>
          <br>
          Note: If the above fails, you can manually download the installer
          <a href="https://getcomposer.org/installer">here</a> and run the same
          commands without the first line. <br>
          <br>
          Note: Composer will just check a few PHP settings and then download
          composer.phar to your working directory. This file is the Composer
          binary. It is a PHAR (PHP archive), which is an archive format for PHP
          which can be run on the command line, amongst other things. <br>
          <br>
          Note: You can place the Composer PHAR anywhere you wish. If you put it
          in a directory that is part of your PATH, you can access it globally.
          On unixy systems you can even make it executable and invoke it without
          directly using the php interpreter. <br>
          <br>
          Note: If you want to run Composer from anywhere on your system, you can
          create a global <code>composer</code> command (on Unix systems) with the
          following commands: <br>
          <br>
          <code>curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php</code>
          <br>
          <br>
          <code>sudo mv composer.phar /usr/local/bin/composer</code>
          <br>
          <br>
          Note: If the above fails due to permissions, you may need to run it
          again with sudo. <br>
          <br>
          Note: If you prefer a graphical user interface (GUI) instead of the
          command line, you can try Composer <a href="https://getcomposer.org/doc/03-cli.md#composer-gui">GUI</a>.
          <br>
          <br>
          Note: If you want to install Composer to be used by all users on your
          system, you may place it in <code>/usr/local/bin</code>. <br>
          <br>
          Note: If you are using SELinux, make sure you have set the
          <code>httpd_execmem</code> permission to allow PHP to execute external
          programs, otherwise you will get a cryptic error message like
          <code>Failed to execute the Phar</code> or <code>phar error: exec
            failed</code>. <br>
          <br>
          Note: If you are using cPanel, you will need to use the command line
          method listed above. <br>

      <h1 class="Section_Title">PHPUnit: The PHP Testing Framework</h1>
      <div class="Definitions">
        <p>
          PHPUnit is a programmer-oriented testing framework for PHP. It is an
          instance of the xUnit architecture for unit testing frameworks. <br>
          <br>
          PHPUnit is the de-facto standard for unit testing in PHP projects. It
          provides both a framework that makes the writing of tests easy as well as
          the functionality to easily run the tests and analyse their results. <br>
          <br>
          PHPUnit is distributed through <a href="https://phar.phpunit.de/">PHAR</a>
          and available on <a href="https://packagist.org/packages/phpunit/phpunit">Packagist</a>.
          It can be installed globally in seconds and is then available to check
          your application. <br>
          <br>
          PHPUnit 9.0 supports PHP 7.3, PHP 7.4, and PHP 8.0. <br>
          <br>
          PHPUnit 8.5 supports PHP 7.2, PHP 7.3, and PHP 7.4. <br>
          <br>
          PHPUnit 7.5 supports PHP 7.1, PHP 7.2, and PHP 7.3. <br>
          <br>
          PHPUnit 6.5 supports PHP 7.0, PHP 7.1, and PHP 7.2. <br>
          <br>
          PHPUnit 5.7 supports PHP 5.6, PHP 7.0, and PHP 7.1. <br>

      <div class="Definitions">
        <p>
          The recommended way to install PHPUnit is via Composer. <br>
          <br>
          <code>composer require --dev phpunit/phpunit</code>
          <br>
          <br>
          Composer will install the proper PHPUnit version in the <code>vendor/bin</code> directory.
